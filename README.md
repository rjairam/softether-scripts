# softether-scripts
This is a simple script I wrote for Flex Radio users to access their radios remotely. 
There is now SmartLink for remote access but some are interested in the VPN so I keep it here.

To package it up I used Makeself:

This is old, but I am updating for the new Softether versions. Stay tuned.
